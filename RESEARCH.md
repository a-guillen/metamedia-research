Holography is a "lenless photography". It is the process of creting an image without the use of a lense. Its main focus is in the use of light. The "photo is called a hologram. Those can be three-dimensional images as well as two dimensional (holgrams in credit cards/stickers). This is evidenced by the fact that you can move your head while viewing the image displayed. 
"Holography is based on the principle of interference. A hologram captures the interference pattern between two or more beams of coherent light (i.e. laser light). One beam is shone directly on the recording medium and acts as a reference to the light scattered from the illuminated scene". 
A holographic image can be seen by looking into an illuminated holographic print or by shining a laser through a hologram and projecting the image onto a screen. 
There are different types of holograms, which were used for especific matters: laser recorded, holographic portraits, rainbow hologram, achromatic hologram. 
There have been many uses for holograms such as: testing and designing new things (industry designers), credit and debit cards, in museums -- display fragile objects --, art, medicine, entertrainment. And it is planned to be use in new tecnology such as holographic television, optical computers, information storage, medical training and commercial security.

- **John Henry Pepper**: A scientist and inventor from London. He developed what was called the Pepper's Ghost, an illusion technique used in theatre, magic tricks, amusement parks, museums, entertrainment and concerts. It is considered the first attempt of holograms. 
- **Gabriel Lipmann**: physist, mathemacitian and inventor from Luxembur, who created the interferential color photography, an early colour technique exploiting the phenomenon of optical standing waves, which followed what people understood about holograms. He won a nobel prize in 1908.
- **Yuri Denisiuk**: a russian scientist, founder of the optical holography. He created the Denisiuk hologram which consists in image recording in three-dimensional environments.
- **Denis Gabor**:he was a hungarian electrical engineer who found the field of holography in 1948 with his holographic theory. Progress in the field was made very slowly until more efficient light sources became available, namely, the laser. He won a nobel prize in 1971. 
- **Paula Dawson**: An australian woman artist -- holographer, sculptor and performer -- who was the first to take advantage of laser transmission hologram in art. She believed that holography was the new art medium of the future.
- **Carl Fredik Reuterswärd**:he was a swedish artist that started with the holographic portraits, using pulsed art. His most famous piece is _"Non violence sculpture"__  which is displayed outside th UN in New York. 
- **Jacques Bousigné**: French artist who used large format rainbow holograms on his art. 
- **Dieter Jung**: Is a german artist specialized in the holography, painting and installation field. He worked with leading scientists to develop a work that expanded the technical and artistic possibilities of holography, and made him one of the leading protagonists of holographic art internationally.
- **Bruce Nauman**: American multimedia artist. 
- **Lloyd Cross**: American phycisist and holographer. He founded the San Francisco's Holography School in 1971 developed the "integral hologram" by combining holography with conventional cinematography to produce three-dimensional images that appeared to move.

1948 = holographic theory/principle: it gives a push to the creation of actual holograms (different types).
1860's = Pepper's Ghost demonstrated for the first time. First contact with holography.
1891 = invention of the interferential color photography by Lippmann. 
1960's = Yuri Denisyuk introduced single-beam reflection holography and is of great importance since it can create remarkable image quality.
1970 = creation of the San Francisco's holography school.
