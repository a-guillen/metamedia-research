    I can't believe today is the day that Apple is finally releasing the Apple-watchXXXXX. I don't usually care about these things, since the last updates to the model have been pretty bad (no change at all). But with this new model, it is actually amazing, and completely worth spending money on it. 
    Two words: holographic calls: Just as the sci-fi movies from a few years ago, we are going to be able to talk to people through holograms that will come out the watches. It's like facetime but cooler. And its compatible with the airpodsXXXXX. It would definitely make the calls easier. 
    
    They teased something about it in 2025, but it was found that those were only rumors. Everybody got their their hopes high for no reason. I think this put so much pressure in the developers and programmers at Apple. I even read on ReddIIt that the people who got a job there got so overworked that most of them quit and fell into bad episodes of depression and anxiety. Scary stuff! But I don't believe it, there's no actual proff of that, and I that would be ilegal, right? I don't know, I really don't want to think about it.  
    
    Anyways, I remember the first time I saw the promo and I was so fucking amazed by it. I just can't believe how close we are from all that utopian society idea. First we got this crazy holograms in malls to display things, and now calling someone else and actually see them in this 3D as if you were with the real person. Also, it is known that Microsoft is working on something like that; a computer that will display your data as a hologram which you can actually touch and use. I can't wait. 
   
	The presale starts in about 30 min. When I get it, I'm going to make a review on it and see if the watch is actually worth it or a waste of money. Stay tuned!

    I went to a therapist and they told me that in order to get my shit together, I should write a journal talking about stuff that has happened to me. I guess it will work? 
    I haven't slept in months. The most sleep I've had are 4 hrs, and that was like 2 weeks ago. And I can't do anything about it since work have been very busy; as if it never ends. Shifts are getting longer and I've taken care of covering some of my coworkers. I should'nt do this but, because of the lack of staff that's been going on, I have no other choice if I don't want to be fired. But even if I quit, I don't have nowhere else to go. 
    Work for programmers are everywhere. With the technology revolution from this decade, 
    
    
    I understand why people would quit this job. It's shit and the payment 
    My head is hurting like hell, 
    
    It's difficult minimum wage/trabajador promedio
