    I can't believe today is the day that Apple is finally releasing the Apple-watchXXXXX. I don't usually care about these things, since the last updates to the model have been pretty bad (no change at all). But with this new model, it is actually amazing, and completely worth spending money on it. 
    Two words: holographic calls: Just as the sci-fi movies from a few years ago, we are going to be able to talk to people through holograms that will come out the watches. It's like facetime but cooler. And its compatible with the airpodsXXXXX. It would definitely make the calls easier. 
    
    They teased something about it in 2025, but it was found that those were only rumors. Everybody got their their hopes high for no reason. I think this put so much pressure in the developers and programmers at Apple. I even read on ReddIIt that the people who got a job there got so overworked that most of them quit and fell into bad episodes of depression and anxiety. Scary stuff! But I don't believe it, there's no actual proff of that, and I that would be ilegal, right? I don't know, I really don't want to think about it.  
    
    Anyways, I remember the first time I saw the promo and I was so fucking amazed by it. I just can't believe how close we are from all that utopian society idea. First we got this crazy holograms in malls to display things, and now calling someone else and actually see them in this 3D as if you were with the real person. Also, it is known that Microsoft is working on something like that; a computer that will display your data as a hologram which you can actually touch and use. I can't wait. 
   
	The presale starts in about 30 min. When I get it, I'm going to make a review on it and see if the watch is actually worth it or a waste of money. Stay tuned!

    I went to a therapist and they told me that in order to get my shit together, I should write a journal talking about stuff that has happened to me. I guess it will work? 
    
    I haven't slept in months. The most sleep I've had are 4 hrs, and that was like 2 weeks ago. And I can't do anything about it since work have been very busy; as if it never ends. Shifts are getting longer and I've taken care of covering some of my coworkers. I should'nt do this but, because of the lack of staff that's been going on, I have no other choice if I don't want to be fired. But even if I quit, I don't have nowhere else to go. 
    
    Work for programmers are everywhere. With the technology revolution from this decade, everything is changing, and the demand for people like me is very high. The bad thing is that because there are a lot of people doing this. Payment is shit, work hours are bad, and job positions are not enough. I think I  got lucky to get a job. Now I understand why people here quit their job. But I can't do that. I need the money and I don't have a second choice to go to. 
    Outside work, things have also been complicated. Everthing is way more expensive than it was before. And is really difficult to find somewhere to live without being a shithole.
    
    I work at Microsoft. I liked the company before I got here. The project we are working on right now is a whole new computer. It will actually be working as a hologram and will have different features. The idea is good, but to actually make it... Not so much. I'm part of the creation of the new programms that we will be released beside the computer. And, I don't why Microsoft would wanted to work on something that ambitious when there hasn't been something that works that way with holograms. We are working alongside scientists and other engineers, but it's just impossible. We just can't create this whole new thing in less than a year. Microsoft announced this project last year, but it hasn't been released yet. Why? Because we don't have enough people, and money, to have the final product. This company is delaying the released, but people are asking for it, so Microsoft puts more and more pressure on us to get it done. 
    
    To be honest, I don't see the computer on the market next year. Not even in two or three years. And I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't continue to live and feel like this. But there's no other choice.
